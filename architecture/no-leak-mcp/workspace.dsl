/*
 * dsh-mcp-guard — the silent egress kill chain, as a versioned model.
 *
 * TAKEN FROM THIS REPO, NOT INVENTED. Every element below is one of the ten lanes declared in
 * diagrams/container-view.gen.js, with its own name and its own [kind]; every step in the dynamic
 * view is one of that file's `steps` rows, with the wording it already uses. Where the generator
 * says `l2` — the bracketed technology, "[MCP]", "[no guard mounted]" — that is carried as the
 * relationship's technology rather than folded into the sentence.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ADDS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. The repo already draws this chain, in sequence style, from
 * a 479-line bespoke generator. This does not replace that plate and does not draw it better: the
 * static export renders a dynamic view in COLLABORATION style, so the lifelines and the bands are
 * lost. What it adds is that the same model now yields the context, container and component views
 * as well, without a second generator; that the palette and the step order are checked rather than
 * eyeballed; and that a reviewer can descend through the levels instead of opening four files.
 *
 * THE SCOPE OF THE TRACE is the leak run — the generator's Band 1 and Band 2a, steps 1 to 11, the
 * chain with no bundle mounted. Band 2b, where the guard cuts it, is a second trace and a separate
 * decision: the operator asked for the kill chain first.
 *
 * ONE STEP WAS DROPPED IN THE FIRST DRAFT AND THE CHECK COULD NOT SEE IT. The trace exported as ten
 * steps against the generator's eleven: "Appends the post call and its result to" was missing, so
 * the store no longer witnessed the outbound post — which is the event the Exfiltration-Chain
 * invariant later reads. checks/diagram-contrast.mjs passed it, correctly: 1..10 is contiguous and
 * in order, and nothing in the export knows what the source narrative contained. A step-order rule
 * catches a renumbering; only a reader catches an omission.

                          suspicion: text that looks like an instruction is not yet an exfiltration.
